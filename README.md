# 3D-Graphics-Learning-through-Games
This is my undergraduate final project, this project aims to use OpenGL develop a learning tool for 3D Graphics. 
In this application, there are two educational focused games and a UI with pages of introduction.

This application is programmed using OpenGL and C++. With standard structure of OpenGL, C++ is used to define single element as a class, every class has one method drawself(), by calling this method, elements are self drawn on the screen.

Although the application achieved it's goal, in good appearance, but the structure in this application is highly redundant, the program runs in low efficiency, all because lack of good software designing at the very beginning of the program.
